# Simple proxy availability tester

Given a list of proxies called `proxy_list.txt`, find out which proxies are available and store them into the file `good_proxies.txt`.

First you will need to install [python-multithreading](https://github.com/doruirimescu/python-multithreading)

Usage: `python3 test_proxy.py`
